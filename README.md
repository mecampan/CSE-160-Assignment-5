CSE-160 Assignment 5: Exploring a High-Level Graphics Library

Criteria:
Basic scene is working - To have a scene with at least 3 different primary shapes (e.g. cube, sphere, cylinder, etc), at least one of these shapes is animated, a directional light source and a camera with perspective projection.
  Three Primary Shapes Include:
    - Sphere for many planets
    - Dodecahedron for the astroids
  
  Animated Shapes:
    - Planets move around in an orbit and also rotate
    - Spaceship OBJ is able to move around with WASD controls
  
  Directional Light:
    - Spot Light on each planet pointed at it that moves with it
  
  Perspective Camera:
    - Implimented

At least one primary shape in your scene is textured.
  - Planets are either textured from a sphere or pulled as an OBJ and texture
  - Skybox also textured

To have a custom textured 3D model (obj file).
  - Some planets are pulled as an OBJ file and textured
  - Spaceship is an OBJ file and textured

To be able to move the camera with orbit controls.
  - Implemented

To have at least 3 different light sources into your scene.
  - Ambient Lighting to prevent planets for appearing too dark on back side
  - Each planet has a spot light pointed at it to simulate the sun
  - Spaceship has point light to cause planets to get a bit brighter as you move closer

To have a skybox in your scene.
  - Implemented

To have at least 20 primary shapes in your scene.
  - 7 Spheres for the planets
  - Thousands of Dodecahedron for the astroids
    
Extra - Picking
  - Planets glow when mouse hovers over them implenting raytracing picking

Extra - Billboards
  - Planets have billboard labels that can be switched on and off

Extra - Multiple Cameras
  - Extra Camera implemented with spaceship. Can be swapped to using the Ship View button from the Gui menu
